# OneEvents
a collection of simple events/utilities for fabric

# Why does this exist?
🚲🏠 + I'm lazy + I plan on expanding this list alot, and if they were all added to fabric API, it would become :b:loated since fabric doesn't have statically declared event listeners

Each file has it's own licence, so make sure to check those
