# OneEvents
a collection of simple events/utilities for fabric
# How do I use this?
  - check in the LOOK IN HERE folder for each event
  - just copy paste the file, if it's in it's own folder, then copy all the classes in the folder
  - each file/folder is it's own thing, none of them depend on each other
# Contributing
  - just add some test code, the mixin / class, and then pr it, make sure to include the licence header
  - make an issue if u need an event, and I'll make it for you!
  
# Why does this exist?
  - 🚲🏠
  - I'm lazy + I plan on expanding this list alot
  - if they were all added to fabric API, it would become :b:loated since fabric doesn't have statically declared event listeners
